*Demo project for Jakarta CDI*

This simple project demonstrates the version 4.0 of Jakarta Context and Dependency Injection (part of JEE 10).

The differences to 2.0 (as part of JEE 8) are mainly the new package names (`javax.$$*$$` -> `jakarta.$$*$$`).

You can now define an asynchronous Method in CDI. This will be shown on an Rest-Endpoint where you can toggle between the "old" EJB-Implementation and the "new" CDI-Asynchronous-Feature.
